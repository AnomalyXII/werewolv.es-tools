Without giving any information about it, without concern for his safety, like he was just casually throwing the claim in the wind and wanted to see what happened. I think he was perhaps trying to lure out the real seer with a counter-claim, or otherwise see what would happen. Of course, provocation is a good way to generate interactions, but a fake seer claim is perhaps the worst thing you can do in this regard. The fact that he restated his status as seer in the evening, during his infamous last-minute vote, confirmed for me that he is carefully trying to gain the status of seer (but first waited if there was a counter-claim during the day), as to gain the trust of village. Also: I think last-minute votes are a bit of a stealthy and unpleasant thing, more often carried out by wolves than by villagers, afaik. Moreover, he tried to shift the blame on me by saying that I was pushing for the lynch earlier so that his vote was my vote. Ridiculous - talking about a lack of taking responsibility of your own actions. I want people to think for themselves, and even if they follow my lead they should have their own arguments for it and take their own responsibiltiy for it.","GameId":"ext-103","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1484312006128+0000)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Seymore","Message":"Wow such a long paragraph pendles.","GameId":"ext-103","TimeStamp":"\/Date(1484312227665+0000)\/"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Seymore","Message":"Umm..
